To whoever is reading this,

I hope you are well. If note I pray that you find grace in these times of great despair.

This is an attempt to climb inside a time capsule and log thoughts surrounding the conception of the project that ended up as the experimental film ‘I DIDN’T ASK TO BE HERE‘ before they crumble and disappear from this feeble thing we call memory.

The first seed was planted way back in the last quarter of 2020 by an image ‘itskvm'(a long time collaborator) had of a lonely figure in his room smoking a cigarette with the weight of the world on their shoulders.

While this might seem minor, it sparked ideas I had previously been thinking about. Ideas of people who came to the slow realization that they didn’t have much choice in who they were, or turned out to be. Coming to an understanding that they were very much products of their upbringing, heightened by whatever interactions they had with the outside world. This information would shape how the film would be conceptualized.

While these initial ideas painted a bleak picture, it gave hope that the realization of this could allow people to grow into something more than what they thought they were. A working progress of defining yourself and working towards the person you want to be. Something that allowed them to make amends with themselves before they passed on the same seed to the next generation.

Kendrick lamar’s Element visuals served as a great inspiration during this time as I interpreted the song and visuals with the same journey as the film, a man caught in between the webs of the influences he grew up around.

I wish I had more to say about this but a lot of time has passed between me writing this and what was the initial conception and shooting of the idea (Over a year and a few months). As natural, much has been lost in the winds of time but the thoughts laid here withstood most. And with that I hope that we learn to unlearn the things that impede our growth, shed off skins that eat away at our souls and always start by serving with compassion.

To the team that made this all possible. I am forever grateful. May grace and mercy follow you all. To whoever is reading this I am grateful you made it this far. May love shower you.

On a last note.
Regarding the title “I DIDN’T ASK TO BE HERE” It was an existential statement posed by someone who came into the realization they were brought into an imperfect world. BUT in hindsight as we all aspire to, would like to make the most of their time here.

Till next time,

Goodbye!
