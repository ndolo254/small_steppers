Bambu was poking at tadpoles all day, with a scrawny little stick. Not to hurt them or anything but just enough to make them change directions and swim away, really, really fast which he loved to see. He didn’t always come up here alone, but his friend Leila had gone up-country for the weekend so he felt a little lonely at the moment. Even the little flies that usually buzzed around were nowhere to be seen.

Soon, he got so bored he started throwing rocks at the bushes around him. TOCK! It hit a black rock. THWIP! It skidded on the pond then rested. THUD! It hit, a rather… odd looking, mushy rock. Then the most amazing thing happened, if you blinked, even for a second you’d have missed it. But if you didn’t, you would have seen what Bambu saw. The mushy rock rose up, looked over the pond then turned itself round and rested again like a normal rock. WHAT?

Bambu was so shocked he’d frozen STILL. Due to this, the rock must not have noticed him when it turned. But just to be sure, Bambu waited, holding his breath, his tiny hands clasping his mouth, forgetting he was still holding the poking stick. Five, six seconds. He took a breath then started heading over. TIP! TOE! TIP! TOE! Bambu slowly crept over, careful not to make a sound. Every now and then turning his head and checking behind and around him for any more ‘weird stuff’. Just a few more steps, till he was close enough. Finally, squatting next to the mushy looking rock and as all little curious children would probably do in this situation. He poked it with a stick.

It didn’t do anything at first, BUT. After a few seconds it slowly opened one eye from it’s side -then quickly closed it. Bambu’s little heart jumped with excitement. ‘HEY YOU!’ He said.’ I saw that’ ‘Saw what?’ Said the mushy rock, forgetting he was disguising himself. ‘YOU! Rocks don’t talk. Or do they…? No they don’t,’ Bambu said reassuring himself. ‘Are you scared? Why are you hiding?’ he asked, leaning in closer.

‘HIDING? HIDING!’ The mere thought of this made the mushy looking rock rise up so you could see its full form. It was a large frog (Bambu would later learn they’re called toads), with rusty green eyes and an earthy, starry underbelly. With little pretty bumps that went throughout its whole body. Its back had little green molds growing out of it, which was what made it look like a rock while it was sleeping. With Bambu crouching, him and the toad were at roughly the same height.

‘A large toad as I simply does not HIDE! I was merely watching the back of my eyelids, trying to concentrate so I can remember what I came here to do,’ the toad stated, lurching its head from side to side looking for something. ‘You’re lying, you were sleeping. Mommy says the same thing when she sleeps on the working desk,’ chuckled Bambu. ‘I do not lie… ’ said the toad, just then a thought popped back into his head.

‘Aha! That’s what it was’ said the toad to himself. ‘How could I forget? I was sent here to look for… fruity pliers? No, we have that. Cheap tyres? No it’s not that, but we do need those. A Tyrant? No. I don’t think so. Hmmm…’ the toad seemed to have forgotten again so Bambu tried to help. ‘A tall client? Mommy says she needs one of those,’ Bambu said. ‘No, but close’ said the toad. Bambu touched his forehead with two fingers so he could think harder. ‘A giant?’ he said, not really sure. ‘YES! A GIANT’ cried the toad. ‘A giant, how unsightly that I would forget, but I got rather distracted by some flies I found around here, quite tasty I must say. But they made me quite sleepy, must have been tsetse flies. They’re quite chunkier and tastier on this side.’ This side? Bambu wondered what that meant. He must be a long way from home. ‘Are you a… (lost frog)’ Bambu was going to ask but the toad spoke faster than he could finish asking. ‘I am ROCKY, THE MOLDY TOAD, rock collector and celebrated three sticks coach’ Rocky said, extending a hand to Bambu, ‘Nice! To meet you Rocky,’ Bambu said, shaking his little toad hand. ‘I am Bambu, bambu the… BAMBU THE SWAMP KING. And… one, two… BAMBU THE MATH-EM-A-TIC-IAN. Yes’ he added proudly.

‘Marvelous. You are a… giant- tiny giant are you not?’said Rocky assessing Bambu closely, who was now standing as Rocky circled around him. Examining him, gesturing little measurements with little hands (At full height Rocky’s head was slightly at Bambu’s hip). ‘I am a big giant! Mommy says very soon I’ll be bigger than her, in one, two… five days’ said Bambu holding three fingers up proudly. ‘Wonderful, wonderful. That will have to do,’ said Rocky. He took out a little notepad from his stomach pouch and started ticking off some things on a checklist.

‘And by any chance are you a brave warrior Bambu?’ added the toad. ‘I AM THE BRAVEST WARRIOR!’ Bambu said, shouting and pointing to the sky with one hand like a superhero. He then proceeded to show off his classy fighting moves. SWISH. SWOOSH. Round kick. PUNCH (He looked really cool). ‘Last week I scared off ALL the birds that came to eat our dhanias (Coriander) with my wooden sword.’ Bambu remarked with enthusiasm. ‘I was so brave, mommy declared me her little knight.’ This was all rather exciting for him at the moment.

‘Good, good, this is a lot of experience, I’ll just put down Mommy as reference.’ Rocky said, finally tucking away his notepad back into his stomach pouch and pulling out a little pocket watch. ‘Oh My! It’s getting rather late! We must be on then… long story short Bambu, our land has become infested with some annoying little pests we can’t get rid off, so the queen has requested for a brave warrior to shoo them off, obviously.’

‘Will you accept this adventure? You shall be rewarded, beautifully of course, if you are to be successful. If not… well-’ Rocky slid his three little fingers across his neck. ‘YES! YES!’ Bambu said jumping up and down, fueled with excitement, not really paying attention to that last part (which he should have). ‘Very well then. We shall go to the queen at once’ Rocky tapped his left foot three times on the ground and the little pond parted to the side and there below was a round wooden door at the bottom of the pond. Rocky jumped inside, pulled open the door and shouted ‘Follow me!’ Bambu  held Rocky’s hand and they both jumped in, falling below into… THE MARSHMELLOW KINGDOM.
