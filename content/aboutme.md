Whom Am I?

Hello There!

I am Ndolo (Gangii), a writer and filmmaker from Nairobi, ke. I harbor a deep appreciation for stories and the different vessels you can carry them in. At the moment I am writing scripts, cobbling together some short stories (centered in Kenyan/African folklore), working on some children’s books and eventually getting into game story development. As it is, I am currently small stepping through these spaces but I do hope we find cozy little nooks in the paths we walk together on.


What is this blog for?

This blog was made with the intention of documenting little notes on projects I have worked on or ones I’m currently navigating through. BUT. It is also my intention to create some original stories just for you ’cause I like you like that’ –see, we’re already friends. Occasionally, I might offer insights into projects that fell through for one reason or another (the joys of daring to dream) and in other instances highlight some of my many interests that are either very satisfying or change the way I perceive things.  I hope to do all these in a manner I find more comfortable and accessible. Which will be mostly through words ‘sometimes I might even spoil you with images and links, though not too much’ 

I hope you stick around for the long run, Big Stepping is just around the corner.
